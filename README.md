# Predicting Mental Health

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset related to depression and mental health to predict whether an individual will have a history of mental illness. The workflow includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
- `scr/`: Contains all the scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- `test/`: Contains unit tests for the main scripts.
- `pdfs/`: PDF copies of the scripts for easy reference.
- `presentation/`: Short presentation for stakeholders summarizing the results.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo and navigate to the project root.
2. Install the required libraries using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run each script in order:
    - `data_preprocessing.py`: Cleans and preprocesses the data.
    - `feature_engineering.py`: Selects and engineers relevant features.
    - `model_training.py`: Trains models and evaluates performance.
    - `evaluation.py`: Generates performance metrics and reports.
